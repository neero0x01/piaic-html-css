    <h1>PIAIC</h1>
    <h3>PRESIDENTIAL ITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING</h3>
    <p>
      Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC)
      is a privately funded not- for-profit educational initiative started by
      President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help
      promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech
      fields like
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud Native Computing</li>
      <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
      <li>Blockchain</li>
      <li>Internet of things</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cloud Native computing:</h2>
    <p>
      The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students to program in
      open source technologies like, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript,
      Node.js, React and React Native while introducing the students to
      development of Microservices and software development techniques on cloud
      platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <h2>Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
    <p>
      The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the
      foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source
      languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask, and
      teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with
      real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>
    <h2>Blockchain:</h2>
    <p>
      The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains
      like Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric), and learn to program in languages
      such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also
      introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks
      like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-
      service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
      of a crypto-token.
    </p>
    <h2>Internet of Things:</h2>
    The Internet of things program introduces the students to open source
    development technologies like Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper,
    Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes while making them efficient in
    developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for
    device control.
